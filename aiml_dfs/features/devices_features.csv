P040033,nxt,3,,N,N,Y,N,The device is to replace the hip joint.,Prosthesis  hip  semi-constrained  metal/metal  resurfacing device has two parts: a socket in the shape of a shallow cup (acetabular component)  and a cap in the form of a ball head (femoral resurfacing component).  The cup replaces the damaged surface of the hip socket (acetabulum). The cap covers or resurfaces the ball-shaped bone at the top of the thigh (femoral head)  and the cap has a small stem that is inserted into the top of the thighbone.  The cap moves within the cup.,The femoral resurfacing component and acetabular components are made of metal. These surfaces rub against each other (the bearing couple) and are made from highly-polished metal. This type of bearing couple is called a metal-on-metal bearing couple.,Prosthesis  hip  semi-constrained  metal/metal  resurfacing device relieves hip pain and improves hip function by replacing the parts of the hip that have been severely damaged by degenerative joint diseases.  This device is indicated for patients with degenerative joint diseases including osteoarthritis  rheumatoid arthritis  traumatic arthritis  dysplasia  or avascular necrosis and for patients who  due to their relatively younger age or increased activity level  may not be suitable for traditional total hip replacement due to an increased possibility of requiring future hip joint revision.
P120005,mds,3,,N,N,N,N,,,,The device is a glucose-monitoring device indicated for detecting trends and tracking patterns in adults (age 18 and older) with diabetes. The device is indicated for use as an adjunctive device to complement  not replace  information obtained from standard home glucose monitoring devices. The system aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia  facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments.
